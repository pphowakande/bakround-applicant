<p>Some jurisdictions to not allow the exclusion or limitation of warranties or damages. In those jurisdictions, the disallowed provisions will be voided with no effect on the remainder of the Terms of Use and/or the disclaimers included in this Agreement.</p>
<p><u>Linked Materials, Third Party Websites, and Third-Party Materials.</u></p>
<p>For purposes of convenience, Bakround&rsquo;s Site and/or Services may include links to third-party products, services and Web sites, as well as materials provided by third parties. Bakround does not endorse, and takes no responsibility for such products, services, Web sites, and materials. You understand that Bakround has no obligation to, and generally does not, approve or monitor materials provided by third parties through the Services. Your dealings with any third party arising in connection with the Services are solely between you and such third party, and Bakround takes no responsibility for any damages or costs of any type arising out of or in any way connected with your dealings with these third parties.</p>
<p><u>Release and Indemnification</u></p>
<p>You release Bakround, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from all liability related to any and all claims and demands you may assert against any third party arising out of the Services. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."</p>
<p>You agree to defend and hold Bakround, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents harmless from any and all claims and demands made by any third-party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms of Use, your use of the Services, your violation of any law or the rights of a third party, or any Submission made through your user account on the Site or that you otherwise make available through your use of Bakround&rsquo;s Services.</p>
<p><u>Choice of Law; Disputes</u></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to its conflict of law provisions. You agree to submit to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts sitting in Wilmington, Delaware for any and all disputes, claims and actions arising from or in connection with the Services and/or these Terms of Use. In any dispute arising under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to attorneys' fees and expenses.</p>
<p><u>Mandatory Arbitration; Agreement to Arbitrate</u></p>
<p>You and Bakround agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Bakround arising in connection with or relating in any way to this Agreement, to Bakround&rsquo;s Site and/or Services, or to your relationship with Bakround as a user of the Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Bakround further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, you and Bakround both agree that nothing in this Agreement to Arbitrate will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. In addition, this Agreement to Arbitrate doesn&rsquo;t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).</p>
<p>If this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreement.</p>
<p>This Agreement to Arbitrate applies only to users in the United States.</p>
<p><u>No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver</u></p>
<p>YOU AND BAKROUND AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Bakround agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&rsquo;s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph&rsquo;s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p>
<p><u>Changes; Discontinuance. </u></p>
<p>Bakround reserves the right to change these Terms of Use at any time in its sole discretion. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised version of these Terms of Use to Bakround&rsquo;s website. Your continued use of the Services after the effectiveness of such changes will constitute acceptance of and agreement to any such changes. You further waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes to these Terms of Use. You are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms of Use. Bakround may alter, suspend or discontinue the Site and Services at any time to you and/or to others, without notice.</p>
